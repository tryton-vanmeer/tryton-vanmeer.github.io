    How I Got Into Linux

    <p>As of this post, I have been a Linux user of some kind for at least 13 years.
I wanted to document how I started using Linux and how I got to where I am now.
I&rsquo;ll be covering the important milestones, since my memory of the specifics is
a bit fuzzy.</p>
<h2 id="first-personal-computer">First Personal Computer</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been into computers since the moment I started using them. For the longest
time, the only computer I&rsquo;ve used is someone else&rsquo;s, such as the shared family
computer. Sometime before high-school, I received a computer of my own. It was
an Acer netbook that ran Windows 7 Starter edition. Windows 7 Starter was only
available in 32-bit and had many limitations, such as not including the Windows
Aero theme.</p>
<h2 id="first-desktop">First Desktop</h2>
<p>During high-school, I was given a desktop that was a significant upgrade over
the netbook. Getting it online while at my father&rsquo;s wasn&rsquo;t an issue, but once back
at my mom&rsquo;s, I didn&rsquo;t have a way to go online. The desktop didn&rsquo;t have Wi-Fi
and I didn&rsquo;t have the privilege of running Ethernet to my bedroom.</p>
<p>I made the logical connection that my netbook had Wi-Fi and I could connect it
to the desktop via Ethernet. Searching online confirmed my theory and I learned
about network bridging. Of course, one of the limitations of Windows 7 Starter
is that it lacked the ability to bridge network adapters.</p>
<p>I eventually came to the solution of using an alternative OS to get around this
limitation: that OS being Linux, of course.</p>
<h2 id="first-distribution">First Distribution</h2>
<p>I remember searching for netbook-oriented distributions and somehow stumbled on
something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joli_OS">Joli OS</a>. Joli OS is
very interesting in retrospect. It was a cloud OS designed for netbooks and
recycled computers in mind and used Chromium for rendering the desktop and web
apps. It was very much a precursor to ChromeOS.</p>
<h2 id="the-rest">The Rest</h2>
<p>After learning of Linux, I began exploring it on the desktop and started
dual-booting Linux Mint. I eventually acquired my new laptop for college and
started using Arch Linux (btw) while continuing to use the Cinnamon desktop
environment.</p>
<p>Since Linux Mint&rsquo;s Cinnamon started as a fork of GNOME 3, and I was experiencing
an issue, I decided to give GNOME a try. This began my love of GNOME as my
forever DE.</p>
<p>While at college, I had switched to Ubuntu GNOME and ended up back on Arch by
the end. The desktop was now running Plex (now using Jellyfin), which ignited my
self-hosting journey. It continued to be my media server until recently.</p>
<p>By the end of college, I was using Linux full-time and haven&rsquo;t used
Windows on a personal computer since.</p>
<p>Around 2020, I moved to Fedora Workstation. Like Arch, Fedora gives you current
software and is upstream first. Most of Fedora Workstations defaults are how I
was configuring or doing things in Arch anyway. I figured why not use a
distribution that aligns with me and is less work.</p>
<p>That concludes my journy from the beginning. From trying to solve a tech problem
to becoming a pro-FOSS Linux user. My distro journy was a bit unusual, and I do
regret never using the canonical (ü•Å) Ubuntu flavour and experiencing Unity. But,
I eventually settled into my two go-to distros: Fedora Workstation and Arch Linux.</p>
