      <description>A while ago I decided to finally switched to ZSH and give it a try. Got it mostly configured to how I wanted it and was satisfied.
Then a friend mentioned he uses Fish. Well, I&amp;rsquo;m already trying an alternative shell, so why not give Fish a go.
Fish. Is. Awesome.
I&amp;rsquo;ve heard about how great Fish and ZSH were but always stuck to just using Bash. I was now thinking to myself, why didn&amp;rsquo;t I try these earlier.</description>

      <description>Linux is my platform of choice for not only daily computing, but also gaming. And I am happy to say I enjoy it quite a lot.
Steam I might not be able to play all the latest AAA games, but I still have more games to play than I have time. Since I stopped using Windows, I&amp;rsquo;ve also made a point to only buy games that support Linux.
There are currently 416 games in my Steam library.</description>
