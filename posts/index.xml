      <description>Linux is my platform of choice for not only daily computing, but also gaming. And I am happy to say I enjoy it quite a lot.
Steam I might not be able to play all the latest AAA games, but I still have more games to play than I have time. Since I stopped using Windows, I&amp;rsquo;ve also made a point to only buy games that support Linux.
There are currently 416 games in my Steam library.</description>
